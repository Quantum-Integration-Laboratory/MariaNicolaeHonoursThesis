    abstract  ="Ultrafast chemical reactions are difficult to simulate because they involve entangled{,} many-body wavefunctions whose computational complexity grows rapidly with molecular size. In photochemistry{,} the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation further complicates the problem by entangling nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. Here{,} we show that analog quantum simulators can efficiently simulate molecular dynamics using commonly available bosonic modes to represent molecular vibrations. Our approach can be implemented in any device with a qudit controllably coupled to bosonic oscillators and with quantum hardware resources that scale linearly with molecular size{,} and offers significant resource savings compared to digital quantum simulation algorithms. Advantages of our approach include a time resolution orders of magnitude better than ultrafast spectroscopy{,} the ability to simulate large molecules with limited hardware using a Suzuki–Trotter expansion{,} and the ability to implement realistic system-bath interactions with only one additional interaction per mode. Our approach can be implemented with current technology; e.g.{,} the conical intersection in pyrazine can be simulated using a single trapped ion. Therefore{,} we expect our method will enable classically intractable chemical dynamics simulations in the near term."

    abstract = {Abstract Quantum information technology based on solid state qubits has created much interest in converting quantum states from the microwave to the optical domain. Optical photons, unlike microwave photons, can be transmitted by fiber, making them suitable for long distance quantum communication. Moreover, the optical domain offers access to a large set of very well-developed quantum optical tools, such as highly efficient single-photon detectors and long-lived quantum memories. For a high fidelity microwave to optical transducer, efficient conversion at single photon level and low added noise is needed. Currently, the most promising approaches to build such systems are based on second-order nonlinear phenomena such as optomechanical and electro-optic interactions. Alternative approaches, although not yet as efficient, include magneto-optical coupling and schemes based on isolated quantum systems like atoms, ions, or quantum dots. Herein, the necessary theoretical foundations for the most important microwave-to-optical conversion experiments are provided, their implementations are described, and the current limitations and future prospects are discussed.},

    abstract = {Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical telecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme, this is impossible because both up- and down-converted sidebands are necessarily present. Here, we demonstrate true single-sideband up- or down-conversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a 3 orders of magnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency, reaching 0.1\% photon number conversion for a 10 GHz microwave tone at 0.42 mW of optical pump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used for nonclassical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1 MHz and is not fundamentally limited.},

    abstract = {Quantum entanglement is a key resource in currently developed quantum technologies. Sharing this fragile property between superconducting microwave circuits and optical or atomic systems would enable new functionalities, but this has been hindered by an energy scale mismatch of \&gt;104 and the resulting mutually imposed loss and noise. In this work, we created and verified entanglement between microwave and optical fields in a millikelvin environment. Using an optically pulsed superconducting electro-optical device, we show entanglement between propagating microwave and optical fields in the continuous variable domain. This achievement not only paves the way for entanglement between superconducting circuits and telecom wavelength light, but also has wide-ranging implications for hybrid quantum networks in the context of modularization, scaling, sensing, and cross-platform verification. Several platforms are under development for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology applications, with each platform operating at different operational wavelengths for optimized performance. For practical technologies, the reality will likely be a hybrid of platforms that require quantum entanglement to be generated and shared across platforms with a large energy disparity. Sahu et al. introduce an electro-optical device that allows the generation of quantum entanglement between microwaves (the operational wavelengths of superconducting circuits) with optical photons (the operational wavelength of long-distance quantum communication). Bridging platforms with more than five orders of magnitude difference in energy scales and maintaining the fragile entanglement provides a route to efficiently linking up hybrid quantum systems. —Ian S.

Erbium ions embedded in crystals have unique properties for quantum information processing, because of their optical transition at 1.5 μm and of the large magnetic moment of their effective spin-1/2 electronic ground state. Most applications of erbium require, however, long electron spin coherence times, and this has so far been missing. Here, by selecting a host matrix with a low nuclear-spin density (CaWO4) and by quenching the spectral diffusion due to residual paramagnetic impurities at millikelvin temperatures, we obtain a 23-ms coherence time on the Er3+ electron spin transition. This is the longest Hahn echo electron spin coherence time measured in a material with a natural abundance of nuclear spins and on a magnetically sensitive transition. Our results establish Er3+:CaWO4 as a potential platform for quantum networks.}

    abstract = {This paper deals with different ways to extract the effective two-dimensional lower level dynamics of a lambda system excited by off-resonant laser beams. We present a commonly used procedure for elimination of the upper level, and we show that it may lead to ambiguous results. To overcome this problem and better understand the applicability conditions of this scheme, we review two rigorous methods which allow us both to derive an unambiguous effective two-level Hamiltonian of the system and to quantify the accuracy of the approximation achieved: the first relies on the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation, while the second resorts to the Green's function formalism and the Feshbach projection operator technique.}

            Optical networks that distribute entanglement among various quantum systems will form a powerful framework for quantum science but are yet to interface with leading quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits. Consequently, these systems remain isolated because microwave links at room temperature are noisy and lossy. Building long distance connectivity requires interfaces that map quantum information between microwave and optical fields. While preliminary microwave-to-optical transducers have been realized, developing efficient, low-noise devices that match superconducting qubit frequencies (gigahertz) and bandwidths (10 kilohertz – 1 megahertz) remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate a proof-of-concept on-chip transducer using trivalent ytterbium-171 ions in yttrium orthovanadate coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide and a microwave transmission line. The device′s miniaturization, material, and zero-magnetic-field operation are important advances for rare-earth ion magneto-optical devices. Further integration with high quality factor microwave and optical resonators will enable efficient transduction and create opportunities toward multi-platform quantum networks.},
